## 📖 Project Description:

* The Animated Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a modern, interactive version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on enhancing the user experience with beautiful dark-themed design, smooth CSS animations, interactive UI elements, and real-time game tracking.

* The game is designed to be visually engaging with:

* A starry animated background that provides a lively atmosphere.

* Responsive UI that adjusts seamlessly across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

* Dynamic hover effects, bounce-in animations for player marks (❌ and ⭕), and a winning line animation that visually highlights the winning combination.

* Game over modal pop-up with a motivational animation to encourage replayability.

In addition to core gameplay mechanics, the project offers score tracking for both players and ties, with options to start a new game or reset the scores.

This project is an excellent example of JavaScript-based game logic, DOM manipulation, and advanced CSS animations packaged into a simple and accessible web-based game.
